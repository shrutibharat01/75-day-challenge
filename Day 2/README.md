# ðŸš€ Day 2/75â€Š-â€ŠData Science Journey

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome back to Day 2 of our 75-Day Data Science Journey!

Today, we dove into the fascinating realm of Python strings, which are super important for working with data. Let's journey together as we learn about strings and discover all the cool things we can do with them!

### Creating a string
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes.

### Accessing substrings from a string
Substrings can be accessed using indexing and slicing. Indexing starts at 0 for the first character.

#### There are 2 types of indexing:
1. Positive indexing
2. Negative indexing

### Deleting a string
Strings in Python are immutable, so you cannot change them directly.

However, you can create new strings based on operations. Deleting can be done using del for variables.

Immutability refers to an objectâ€™s inability to be changed after it has been created.

### Operations on a string
Various operations like arithmetic, loops on strings, and membership operators can be performed on strings.

### String Functions
Python provides many built-in functions to manipulate strings

### Bonus Tips
1. String formatting in Python is the process of embedding variables and expressions within string literals to create dynamic and readable text output.

2. A raw string in Python is a string prefixed with r or R, which treats backslashes \ as literal characters, ignoring their escape functionality.

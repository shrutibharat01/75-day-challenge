# Python Lists


## ðŸš€ Day 3/75â€Š-â€ŠData Science Journey

Hey ðŸ‘‹!! Welcome back to Day 3 of our 75-day Data Science Journey. Today, we're diving deeper into the world of Python programming and exploring the power of lists. From creating and manipulating lists, we'll cover it all. Let's learn about lists and discover all the cool things we can do with them.

## List

A list is a data structure where you can store multiple items under one name.
Lists act like dynamic arrays, meaning you can add more items on the fly.

### Array Vs List

- **Fixed Vs Dynamic**
- **Homogenous Vs Heterogeneous**
- **Fast Vs Slow**
- **Less memory Vs more memory**

### Memory Allocation
l = [1, 2, 3, 4]

## Characteristics of list

- A mutable, ordered collection of items.
- Items can be of different types.
- Supports indexing, slicing, and various methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements.

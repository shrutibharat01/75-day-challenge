## List

A list is a data structure where you can store multiple items under one name.
Lists act like dynamic arrays, meaning you can add more items on the fly.

### Array Vs List

- **Fixed Vs Dynamic**
- **Homogenous Vs Heterogeneous**
- **Fast Vs Slow**
- **Less memory Vs more memory**

### Memory Allocation
l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
![]()

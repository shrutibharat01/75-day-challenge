# ðŸš€ Day 5/75 â€” Data Science Journey

Welcome to Day 5 of my 75-day Data Science Journey!

## Overview
Day 5 was all about mastering Pythonâ€™s foundational data structures: tuples, sets, and dictionaries. From understanding their unique characteristics to exploring powerful operations and methods, we delved deep into their versatility. 

## Table of Contents
- [Tuple](#tuple)
- [Set](#set)
- [Frozenset](#frozenset)
- [Dictionary](#dictionary)

## Tuple
- **Ordered**: The elements in a tuple have a defined order.
- **Immutable**: The elements of a tuple cannot be changed after the tuple is created.
- **Heterogeneous**: Tuples can contain elements of different types.
- **Indexable**: Elements can be accessed using an index.
- **Duplicates**: Tuples can contain duplicates.

## Set
- **Unordered**: The elements in a set do not have a specific order.
- **Unique Elements**: A set automatically removes duplicate elements.
- **Mutable**: You can add and remove elements from a set.
- **No Indexing**: Since sets are unordered, they do not support indexing or slicing.

## Frozenset
- Frozensets are like immutable sets in Python.
- Once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
- Theyâ€™re useful for storing unique, immutable collections and can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets.

## Dictionary
- **Unordered**: The order of elements in a dictionary is not guaranteed.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Each element in a dictionary consists of a key-value pair. The key is used to access the corresponding value.
- **Mutable**: Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs.
- **Key Uniqueness**: Keys within a dictionary must be unique. If you try to add a duplicate key, the existing value associated with that key will be overwritten.

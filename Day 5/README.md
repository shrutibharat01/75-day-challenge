## Argument Vs Parameter
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

## *args Vs **kwargs
These special Python keywords are used to pass various arguments to a function.
- `*args`: Allows passing a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function.
- `**kwargs`: Allows passing any number of keyword arguments. Internally, Python stores all values in a tuple for `*args` and in a dictionary for `**kwargs`.

## Memory Execution
Real-life example:
- Complete RAM: City
- Program scope/Global frame: House
- Function scope: 1 room in that house

## Namespaces (Variable scope)
Namespace is a system that ensures names are unique and can be used to avoid naming conflicts.
- **Built-in**: Contains all built-in functions and exceptions. Loaded automatically when Python starts up.
- **Global**: Contains names defined at the top level of the script or module. Remains active throughout the module.
- **Local**: Created for each function call. Contains names defined within that function. Destroyed once the function call is completed.
- **Enclosing Namespace (Non-local Namespace)**: Allows inner functions to access variables from the enclosing function‚Äôs scope.

## Nested functions
- **Simple Nested Function**: Inner function is defined inside outer function. Accessed only within the outer function.
- **Returning Nested Function**: Outer function returns inner function, accessible from external functions.
- **Passing Arguments to Nested Function**: Inner function accepts an argument, passed when calling the returned function.
- **Closure**: Inner function has access to variables from the enclosing scope of outer function.

## Decorators
Functions themselves that take another function as an argument and return a new function.
- Use cases: Logging, timing, authentication/authorization.

## Functions are 1st class citizen
Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

## Lambda functions
- Defined using `lambda` keyword.
- Used for short, anonymous functions.

## Higher order functions
Functions that take another function as an argument or return a function as its result.
- **Map**
- **Filter**
- **Reduce**

## Coding Problems
- Python Program to Find LCM
- Python Program to Find HCF
- Python Program to Convert Decimal to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal
- Python Program To Find ASCII value of a character
- Python Program to Make a Simple Calculator
- Python Program to Display Calendar

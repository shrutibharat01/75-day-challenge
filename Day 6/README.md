# üöÄ Day 6 of our Data Science Adventure!

Today, we plunged into Python‚Äôs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), sculpting code with the finesse of artisans. Exploring classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, we‚Äôre crafting a tapestry of possibilities. With each line, we‚Äôre not just coding; we‚Äôre shaping the future of data science. So brace yourself for an exhilarating journey as we unleash the magic of OOP in our 75-day challenge! üë©‚Äçüíªüîç‚ú®

## Class and Object
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- An object is an instance of a class.

## Method Vs Function
- A method is associated with an object.
- A function is a block of reusable code.

## Magic (Dunder) Methods & Constructor
- Special methods like `__init__` and `__str__`.
- Constructor (`__init__`) initializes an object.

## Self Keyword
- Refers to the instance of the class.

## Reference Variables
- Hold the objects and can have multiple references.

## Encapsulation
- Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single class.

## Static Vs Instance Variables
- Static variables are shared among all instances.
- Instance variables are specific to each instance.

## Aggregation
- A design principle where one class contains objects of another class.

## Inheritance
- A mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class.

## Types of Inheritance
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance
3. Multilevel Inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

## Polymorphism
- The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call.

## Abstraction
- Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.

## Coding Problems
1. Python program to build flashcards using a class.
2. Shuffle a deck of cards with OOP in Python.
3. How to create an empty class in Python?
4. Student management system in Python.

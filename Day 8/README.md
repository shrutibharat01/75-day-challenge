# üöÄ Day 8 of our Data Science Adventure!

Today, we‚Äôre diving into the dynamic world of **NumPy**! Like explorers discovering new lands, we‚Äôll uncover the power of NumPy for numerical computing. We‚Äôll navigate through its arrays, operations, and powerful functions, turning data manipulation into a seamless process. With each command, we‚Äôre not just coding; we‚Äôre unlocking the potential to handle large datasets efficiently and perform complex calculations with ease. So buckle up for an exhilarating journey as we conquer NumPy in our 75-day challenge! üë©‚Äçüíªüî¢‚ú®

## NumPy Overview

- **NumPy** is written in C language.
- By default, the value of a NumPy array is float.
- At the core of the NumPy package is the `ndarray` object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types.
- NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation. Unlike Python lists, which can grow dynamically.
- Changing the size of `ndarray` will create a new array and delete the original.
- NumPy arrays are faster than Python lists.
- NumPy arrays occupy less memory than Python lists.
- NumPy arrays are C-arrays and static while Python lists are referential arrays and dynamic.

## Creating a NumPy Array

To create a NumPy array, you can use various functions like `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.full`, `np.eye`, `np.arange`, and `np.linspace`.

## Array Attributes

NumPy arrays have several attributes such as `ndim`, `shape`, `size`, `dtype`, `astype`, and `itemsize`.

## Array Operations

You can perform various operations on NumPy arrays including arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and more.

## Reshaping

Reshaping allows you to change the shape of an array without changing its data.

## Stacking & Splitting

NumPy provides functions to stack and split arrays like `np.vstack`, `np.hstack`, `np.split`, `np.array_split`, `np.dsplit`.

## Indexing & Slicing

You can access array elements and slice arrays to create subarrays.

## Array Functions

NumPy offers a variety of functions to perform operations on arrays including mathematical functions, statistical functions, sorting functions, and more.

## Broadcasting

Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.

## Working with Missing Values

NumPy provides tools to handle missing values in arrays using `np.nan`, `np.isnan`, `np.nan_to_num`.

## Working with Random Functions

NumPy includes functions to generate random numbers and perform random sampling like `np.random.rand`, `np.random.randint`, `np.random.choice`, `np.random.shuffle`.
